                <p id="pad">My name is DeLaney Jones, and I am studing at Lewis-Clark State College. I will graduate in 2020 with an Associates in Web Design and a Bachelors in Computer Science. Currently I work for Dr. Seth Long as a Research Assistant and we are working on a program called CASTER (Computer Assisted Segmentation Tool Enviroment Revisited). The goal of this program is to outline rod spherules within mouse eyes for further study. I have attended several research confrences to present our works, which as been well received. My resume can be viewed in this section.
