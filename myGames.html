                <h2> <a name="monsterIntro">Monster School</a></h2>
                <p>The goal of the Monster School series is to help children learn in a manner that works for them and at their own pace. This is going to be achieved by recording what the child is doing well with, and where they need more practice. After those spots are identified, the materials for the games are ajusted to suit those individual needs. </p>

                <p>The other approach that is being incroperated into the system is appealing to the different ways of learning. Games for each major subject are presented in a way that uses audio, logic, visual, verbal methods. The only learning style that cannot be achieved by simply playing the games is interpresonal learning.</p>

                <p>The tartet of this game is to help give students the base information they need for understanding geography and history. In this game, players travel around the world via a map. At each place they visit, they learn about something fun that can be done there, as well as a fun fact. Did you know you can find fish fossils in the Gobi desert?</p>

                <p>There are ten different locations starred on the board, and each one represpents a possible destination location. At each location, the player learns something about that area and something that they really can go do there! This makes for 100 fun facts from around the world!</p>

                <p>This game target reading and phonics. It begins by helping people learn their alphabet and correlating sounds, then moves into teaching sight words. This is achieved via a see-hear-match-reward-repeat process, which has shown promising results.</p>

                <p>For the child, they see the word (either a sight word or a letter), hear the sound that it makes, and then match the word to the corresponding word on the colored mats. From there, they pick out the monster part they want. My sister loved making belly-buttons eyeballs!</p>

                <p> The target of Monster Munch is math. The players are given a monster to feed that requires X amount of food points. They need to use the food avaiable to them to meet those needs without over or under feeing the monster. Food items are presented on medalians, designed to help the player transition to understanding coins.</p>

                <p>Players choose between feeding a monster durring a turn, or visiting the store to restock on food. The medalions that the foods are printed on are the same size as the U.S. currency they represent. This helps prepare children for understanding the value of different coins. </p>
