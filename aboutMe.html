                <p id="pad">My name is DeLaney Jones, and I am studing at Lewis-Clark State College. I will graduate in 2020 with an Associates in Web Design and a Bachelors in Computer Science. Currently I work for Dr. Seth Long as a Research Assistant. We are working on a program called CASTER (Computer Assisted Segmentation Tool Enviroment Revisited). The goal of this program is to outline rod spherules within mouse eyes for further study. I have attended several research confrences to present our works, which as been well received.

                <h2>My education</h2>

                <p id="pad">I started gaining an interest in computer science in juionor high. I wanted to know how the computer worked on the inside, and started keeping a journal about computer facts. I continued working on filling up my journal through high school, but dropped it when I started college. I took my first year at Walla Walla community college, and then took a year off for medical reasons. Durring that time, I was homeschooling my little sister through Preschool. However, I was diapointed in the resources I could find to teach her. This encouraged me to create my own games that met her needs and kept her interest. Since then, I have been working on creating a Monster School series to provide those games and more to other children who can use them.</p>

                </p>
                <h2>My Drawings</h2>
                <p>I drew the turtle in the upper left hand corner based on a photo from Altru Vistas Cuba Oceanic Society. I see turtles as a symbol of freedom, so I really like them. They are beautiful and elegant, and I feel honored to represent them in drawings. This particular drawing took about six months to complete, and I used colored pencils as my medium.</p>

                <h2>My Kitten</h2>
                <p>In around June of 2018, a litter of kittens showed up in my backyard. I took most of them to the animal shelter, but I feel in love with this one. I named her Sophia, and we are very close. She provides me with a time-based routeen, which really helps me. I'm training her to follow simple commands, and she is already leash trained. If I am home, she is never far from me. </p>

                <p id="pad">I made this dessert because I found heavy whipping cream in the fridge that needed to be used up. I wanted to see what I could do, and eventually ending up with this as my end product. It is a chocolate bowl filled with three layers: chocolate moouse, raspberry moouse, and marshmallow moouse, and topped with a swirl of whipped cream and a raspberry cream chocolate.</p>
