                    I graduated Charles Fransis Adams High School, commonly known as CHS, in 2014. That same year I started college at Walla Walla Community College's Clarkston Branch. I spent one year there with the help of a College Bound Scholarship. Afterwards, I needed to take a year off for family and medical reasons. I began the following year, in 2016, at Lewis Clark State College where I am continuing my studies. I am going to obtain an Applied Associates in Web Design and a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science. I am used to working with many kinds of computers including Microsoft, Linux, and Apple.

            <p id="pad">
                I help fund my education though some work under Dr. Samuel Seth Long at Lewis-Clark State College. Since starting in May of 2016, I have recieved the Higher Education Research Council Undergraduate Research award for both 2017 and 2018, as well as the INBRE Summer 2018 Undergraduate Fellowship Grant. I have been working on a 3D rod spherule outliner, CASTER, to identify any mutations that may be occurring. In simpler terms, there are connections in the eye to let the brain know what they eyes are seeing. I am simply outlining part of this pathway to help analyze it.

            <h2>CASTER</h2>
            <p>
                As medical research advances, so does the demand for ways to discover and analyze new data. One area of biomedical research is to identify specific genes and the effects they have in the body. Once genes are better understood, scientists can discover better treatment options. 

                A big holdup on cellular analysis is how long it takes to identify structures and to see how they interact with whatâ€™s around them. CASTER is a program designed to speed up this process by automatically outlining membranes. This program uses contrast within the image and a line of best fit. From there, the user can display a 3D image to help analyze the data.
            </p>
            <p>
                To get the image stack, a process known as Serial Block-Face Imaging was used. Mice were used to obtain the biological samples.

                            <li><b>Set imaging parameters</b>: Select beam conditions, magnification, pixel count and dwell time. This sets your resolution, field-of-view and acquisition time.</li>
                            <li><b>Automated imaging</b>: Sequential images are acquired. The knife automatically removes a layer before each image.</li>
                            <li><b>Analysis</b>: The images are stacked to construct a 3D dataset. This can be processed and viewed in Gatanâ€™s DigitalMicrograph or third-party software. Segmentation and quantification can be performed.</li>

                    <p>The first way to use CASTER is to set the number of boxes made to zero, turning off the automatic membrane outlining. This is helpful in areas where the contrast is not well defined. As the user drags their mouse, the program selects the points in that area that are most likely part of the membrane.</p>

                    <p>The second way is to set the number of boxes to anything else, and the program will highlight the well-defined membrane. The selected points are based on how the sliders were set. The user clicks on a single point on the membrane, and the program works outwards from there to select the membrane.</p>

            <h2>Poster Presentations</h2>
            <p>
                I have presented my research at the 2018 ICUR conference in Boise, ID as well as the INBRE conference in Moscow, ID. This summer, I will be presenting at the ICUR conference again. All of my presentations have been well recieved, and I have gotten some intersting questions about it. My favorite being if CASTER can sucessfully outline star clusters, which it can if the settings are properly adjusted.
