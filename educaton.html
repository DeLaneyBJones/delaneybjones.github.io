                    I graduated Charles Fransis Adams High School, commonly known as CHS, in 2014. That same year I started college at Walla Walla Community College's Clarkston Branch. I spent one year there with the help of a College Bound Scholarship. Afterwards, I needed to take a year off for family and medical reasons. I began the following year, in 2016, at Lewis Clark State College where I am continuing my studies. I am going to obtain an Associates in Web Design and a Bachelors of Computer Science. In the sections that follow, I have listed some of the classes I have taken.

                I help fund my education though some work under Dr. Samuel Seth Long at Lewis-Clark State College. Since starting in May of 2016, I have recieved the Higher Education Research Council Undergraduate Research award for both 2017 and 2018, as well as the INBRE Summer 2018 Undergraduate Fellowship Grant. I have been working on a 3D rod spherule outliner, CASTER, to identify any mutations that may be occurring. In simpler terms, there are connections in the eye to let the brain know what they eyes are seeing. I am simply outlining part of this pathway to help analyze it.

            What's the big picture? The medical field is expanding quickly, and we need the tools avalible to continue this expansion. One of the things being worked towards are cures and better treatment options for long term illnesses. To do so, we first need to better understand what's causing the effects we are seeing. This means examining what's going on inside our bodies with greater detail than before. Of course, it's easiest to see what's going on when working with 3D models. That way, we can see things from all angles and how it is interacting with it's enviroment. Once we know that, people can start working on cures.

                I have presented my research at the 2018 ICUR conference in Boise, ID as well as the INBRE conference in Moscow, ID. This summer, I will be presenting at the ICUR conference again. All of my presentations have been well recieved, and I have gotten some intersting questions about it. My favorite being if CASTER can sucessfully outline star clusters, which it can if the settings are properly adjusted. The blank rectangle space in the lower right hand side displayed a video which I have linked here:
